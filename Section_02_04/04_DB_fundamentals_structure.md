- **Fields:** are at the top of the database table and refers to the type of the data value.

- **Records:** are the line of fields in a database table.

## $${\color{green}NULL \space\space Value}$$

**NULL value**

A **NULL** value represents the *absence of a value* in a column of a table. This indicates that no value has been assigned in that particular column.

***NULL*** *values* are different from blank values or numeric values like 0 (zero), as the latter are valid values that can be assigned to a column. For example, in a Taxes table, some values in a column may contain 0 (zero), while others may have no tax value assigned yet, in which case the column would have a `NULL value`.

## $${\color{green}Primary\space\space Key\space\space and\space\space Foreign\space\space Key}$$

**Primary Key**

A **Primary Key** is a concept in relational databases that refers to a field or set of fields in a table whose *values are unique for each row* in the table. The main function of a *Primary Key* is to provide a *unique way to identify each record in the table*.

1. **Uniqueness**: Each value in the designated column or set of columns as the `primary key must be unique for each row` in the table. This ensures that there are no duplicates in the primary key column.

2. **Non-nullability**: Values in the primary key `cannot be null` (NULL). Each row must have a unique and non-null value in the primary key column.

3. **Unique Identification**: The primary key is `used to uniquely identify each row in the table`. This is essential for `establishing relationships between tables` in relational databases.

4. **Composite Key**: a table may have `more than one PK field as a Secondary Key field`

5. **Just One PK**: In a relational database, *each table can have only one Primary Key*.

<br><br>

**Foreign Key**

- A **foreign key** refers to a field (or set of fields) in a database table that `references the Primary Key in another table`. Its main purpose is to establish a relationship between the two tables.

- The `Foreign Key serves as a link between tables` and ensures referential integrity in the database. This means that the values in the `Foreign Key column must match the values in the Primary Key of the referenced table` or can be null if allowed.

- The relationship created by the Foreign Key is crucial for maintaining consistency in the database and enables queries and operations involving data from both tables.

- A table may have more than one Foreign Key.

## $${\color{green}Database\space\space Normalization}$$


**Database normalization** is a process in database design that involves organizing tables and fields to reduce redundancy and dependency. The goal is to improve data integrity and minimize data anomalies in a relational database.

The primary objectives of database normalization include:

1. **Eliminating data redundancy:** Storing data in a way that avoids unnecessary duplication.

2. **Reducing data anomalies:** Ensuring that updates, inserts, and deletes in the database do not lead to unexpected issues, such as inconsistencies or errors.

3. **Improving data integrity:** Establishing relationships between tables to maintain accuracy and reliability of data.

<br>

**Normal Forms**

***First Normal Form (1NF):***
A table is said to be in First Normal Form if and only `if all its fields (attributes) contain atomic values.` This means that each attribute of the table should have a unique value for an occurrence of the entity. Repeating groups are not allowed.

***Second Normal Form (2NF):***
A table is in Second Normal Form if and only `if it is in 1NF, and all non-key attributes are fully functionally dependent on the primary key.`

***Third Normal Form (3NF):***
A table is in Third Normal Form if and only `if it is in 2NF, and non-key attributes are independent of each other.` This means that the values of attributes depend only on the primary key and do not depend on another non-key attribute. The value of the attribute should not depend on the value of another non-key attribute.

## $${\color{green}Data \space\space Types}$$

**Data Types**

In SQL, a data type `refers to the type of values that can be stored` in a column of a table. Data types in SQL specify the kind of information each column can hold and also determine how that information is stored and manipulated.

#### Units of Measurement in Computer Science:

- *Bit* = 0 ó 1
- *Byte* = 8 bits
- *Kilobyte* = 1024 bytes
- *Megabyte* = 1024 kilobytes
- *Gigabyte* = 1024 megabytes
- *Terabyte* = 1024 gigabytes
- *Petabyte* = 1024 terabytes 

### Common data types:

1. **INTEGER/INT:** To store whole numbers.

2. **VARCHAR(n)/CHAR(n):** VARCHAR for variable-length strings and CHAR for fixed-length strings, where "n" represents the maximum length of the string.

3. **FLOAT/REAL/DOUBLE:** To store decimal or floating-point numbers.

4. **DATE/TIME/DATETIME:** To store dates and times.

5. **BOOLEAN/BOOL:** To store logical values (true/false).

6. **NUMERIC/DECIMAL:** To store decimal numbers with fixed precision.
