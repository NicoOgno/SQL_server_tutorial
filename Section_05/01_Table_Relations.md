# $${\color{orange}Referential\space Integrity\space Rules}$$

**Primary Key Constraint:** A primary key constraint ensures that a column or a set of columns within a table uniquely identify each row in that table.

**Foreign Key Constraint:** A `foreign key` constraint `establishes a relationship between two tables`, where the `foreign key in one table refers to the primary key in another table`.

**Referential Integrity:** Referential integrity `ensures that relationships between tables are maintained`; it ensures that the foreign key value of each row in one table corresponds to a valid primary key value in the related table.

**CASCADE:** The CASCADE option `specifies that changes to a primary key will propagate to the foreign key`, maintaining referential integrity. For example, if a primary key is deleted, CASCADE will delete corresponding foreign key values.

**RESTRICT:** The RESTRICT option `prevents any action that would destroy referential integrity`, typically by `preventing deletion or modification of the primary key if it has dependent rows in another table`.

**NO ACTION:** Similar to RESTRICT, the NO ACTION option `prevents the deletion or modification of a primary key if it has dependent rows in other tables`.

**SET NULL:** When a row in the parent table `(primary key) is deleted or updated`, the corresponding `foreign key values in the child table are set to NULL`.

**SET DEFAULT:** If a `primary key value is deleted or updated`, the `foreign key` values in the related table are `set to their default values`.

**CHECK Constraints:** These constraints `allow you to define rules that restrict the values that can be inserted or updated in a column`.

> [!NOTE]
> üìù
> These rules help maintain data integrity in a relational database, ensuring that relationships between tables are coherent and consistent.

## $${\color{green}Database\space Diagrams\space DER}$$

**Create DB Diagram:** in `Object Explorer` got to your Database right click `Database Diagrams` ‚û°Ô∏è `New Database Diagram`, then add the tables you wish to see.

**Create Foreign Key:** in `Object Eplorer` got to the table you want to put the `FK`, right click on folder `Keys` ‚û°Ô∏è `New Foreign Key`. Then in the prompt (*Foreign Key Relationships*) go to `Tables And Columns Specification`. Then click the 3 dots button next to `Tables And Columns Specification`. There `set the Primary Key Table and the field` and do the same for the `Foreign Key Table`. Or make it the same way but in the `Database Diagrams` giving right click to a table and setting the relations.

**Give more than one Foreign Key:** If a table already have a `FK` click the `Add` button at the left bottom corner. Then proceed as specified above in `Tables And Columns Specification`.

**Create Relations from the Diagram window (`DER`):** In the Diagram window choose the field in the table you want to make the relation *click and **Drag** to the table in the Specific field you want the Foreign Key to be*. The prompt `Tables And Columns Specification` will open, to confirm the relation click OK. Finally save the changes in your Diagram to see the changes reflected.

Then click OK and Close. Finally save the changes to the table üíæ.

> [!NOTE]
> üìù
> The Database Diagram will automatically generate the visual relation between tables.

> [!TIP]
> üß†
> If you have many tables in your `Database Diagram` right click in the Diagram window ‚û°Ô∏è `Arrange Tables` will help to organice the visualization.
>
> Right click on the restriction between tables (link) ‚û°Ô∏è `Properties` will give info about the `PK`, `FK` and more.

> In your `Database Diagram` the restriction between tables (link) tells you the relation between Tables 8 (infinit) means there are many of that and üóùÔ∏è (key) means one.

### $${\color{green}Delete\space Foreign\space Key\space üîë‚ùå}$$

* In `Object Explorer` go to `Tables/Keys` right click on the `Foreign Key` ‚û°Ô∏è `Delete`. Or in the `Database Diagram` right click on the restriction (link) ‚û°Ô∏è `Delete Relationships from Database` and then save the Diagram üíæ.

<br><br>

### $${\color{green}Modify\space Diagram}$$

* In `Object Explorer` go to YourDB/Database_Diagrams, double click on the Diagram you want to modify and make right click in the `Diagrams window`. You will be able to add Tables and more.

<br><br>

### $${\color{green}Many\space to\space Many\space Relation}$$

* To make a `Many to Many` relation between two tables you have to make a third table to relate them in order to keep the `Referential Intregrity Rules`.

> If one table is "New" (empty) and the other already has data, create the `Foreign Key` in the "Empty Table".
