## Scheduled Jobs

 You can create scheduled jobs using *SQL Server Agent* to automate various tasks such as running queries, executing stored procedures, performing backups, sending notifications, and more.

 ### Creating a Scheduled Job

 <br>

 1. **Create a New Job:**

        USE msdb;
        GO

        EXEC dbo.sp_add_job
          @job_name = N'YourJobName',
          @enabled = 1,
          @description = N'Your job description';

2. **Add a Job Step:**

        EXEC dbo.sp_add_jobstep
          @job_name = N'YourJobName',
          @step_name = N'YourStepName',
          @subsystem = N'TSQL',
          @command = N'YourTSQLCommandHere';

3. **Schedule the Job:**

        EXEC dbo.sp_add_schedule
          @schedule_name = N'YourScheduleName',
          @freq_type = 4, -- 4 indicates daily; change as needed for other frequencies
          @freq_interval = 1, -- Daily frequency interval
          @active_start_time = 100000, -- Specify the time (HHMMSS format)
          @schedule_id = 1; -- Assign a schedule ID

This example schedules a daily job that starts at 10:00 AM.

4. **Attach the Schedule to the Job:**

        EXEC dbo.sp_attach_schedule
          @job_name = N'YourJobName',
          @schedule_name = N'YourScheduleName';

Associate the previously *created schedule* (`YourScheduleName`) with your *job* (`YourJobName`).

5. **Start the Job:**

        EXEC dbo.sp_start_job N'YourJobName';

Initiate the job manually if you want it to run immediately.
